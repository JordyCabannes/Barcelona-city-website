# Barcelona-city-website
During my exchange semester we had to design a website with at least five pages about something that interest us. I decided to develop a website which presents the Barcelona city where I have been twice. I made this website with HTML5 and CSS3, unfortunately there is no database to store registrations.

Website address : http://barcelona.esy.es/
